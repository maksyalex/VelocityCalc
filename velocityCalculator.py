#Behold!...... a basic velocity calculator
#v = d/t
import math 
# d is distance... 
d = float(input("Enter distance you are going / have gone just numbers as a whole or decimal in KM: "))
# t is time...
t = float(input("How many minutes did it take you: "))
# v is velocity 
v = d/t 
print('Your velocity is ', v, "per minute")
# there is much more to it, this is just extremely basic calculation based on some very traditional physics concepts.
